# ü§ñ IntelliDocs-RAG: Local PDF Chatbot using RAG & Offline LLM

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

**IntelliDocs-RAG** is an intelligent chatbot system that lets users chat with their own PDF documents securely and privately ‚Äî with **zero internet dependency**. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and a local LLM (via Ollama), the app provides fast, offline, and context-aware responses based on the content of multiple uploaded PDFs.

This project was developed as a **Final Year B.Tech Project** at the **National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra (NIT Kurukshetra)**.

## üß† Real-World Use Case

> **Imagine a researcher working in a remote lab** with no internet access. They have a dozen PDF research papers on their topic and want quick answers without manually reading each one. Using **IntelliDocs-RAG**, they upload all PDFs and ask:
>  
> *"What are the key findings of paper 3?"*  
> *"Which papers discuss deep learning on time-series data?"*  
>  
> The system quickly returns accurate answers powered by a local LLM ‚Äî no internet, no privacy concerns, and no hassle.

## üîí Why This Project Matters

Modern LLM apps often rely on cloud APIs (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic), making them:

- ‚ùå **Dependent on Internet Connectivity**
- ‚ùå **Risky for Confidential or Academic Documents**
- ‚ùå **Expensive with Limited API Quotas**

**IntelliDocs-RAG** solves this by offering:

‚úÖ **Offline LLM Access via Ollama**  
‚úÖ **Privacy-Focused Architecture** (local embeddings & vector search)  
‚úÖ **Open-source & Customizable for Any Domain**
